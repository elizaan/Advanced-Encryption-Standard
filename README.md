# Advanced-Encryption-Standard
AES is an encryption standard chosen by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, USA to protect classified informaton. It has been accepted worldwide as a desirable encryption algorithm to encrypt sensitive data.
It is a block cipher which operates on 128 bits for both encrypting as well as decrypting.
Each round performs the same operation.
To know more please read the pdfs attached.
Here in this code, I have implemented AES encryption, decryption, encryption for image/pdf/text files as well texts. Also implented the Sbox and Inverse Sbox according to the algorithm found on wikipedia.
